Forgot to make this file 2 days ago when i first started learning javascript, but the first day i learned how to do basic javascript, it was very messy, didnt know functions parameters etc. day 2 i learned functions, made some big changes to some projects i did along the way, made the code nicer and easy to read on most of the projects too. today i didnt do much, learned JSON and localStorage, also added it to my rock paper scissors project so that when u refresh the page the score doesnt change, also added a win tie loss ratio to rps, the more i learn the neater the code gets. Thats all for now.
